/***
 * Explorer.js
 *
 * This file defines the Explorer class, which transforms the graphics buffer
 * that the Tree class uses to draw itself to allow for users to pan and zoom
 * as they view the binary tree.
 *
 * The Explorer uses the translate and scale functions without resetting the
 * transformation at the end of the frame. This allows pieces of the picture to
 * be updated without redrawing the entire picture, which can improve
 * performance. The Explorer currently must redraw the picture whenever the user
 * pans or zooms. Ideally, the explorer could simply change the size and
 * position of the graphics, but the way the canvas works, the picture would
 * be blurry when zoomed in. It may be possible to achieve this behavoir with
 * svg graphics instead, but that's a project for the future.
 *
 * The Explorer class relies on a graphics buffer to transform, a draw function
 * to redraw the picture in the graphics buffer, and a DOM object for the canvas
 * to register event listeners for panning and zooming
